## ðŸ§© How to Use This Starter for New Challenges

Follow these steps to create a new React + Tailwind + Vite project inside your existing monorepo using this starter.

### âœ… Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Go to the root of the monorepo** (if you're not already there):

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/MERN-learning-journey
````

2. **Remove `node_modules` from the starter** (to avoid copying unnecessary files):

   ```bash
   rm -rf react-tailwind-starter/node_modules
   ```

3. **Copy the starter to a new challenge folder** (replace with your challenge name):

   ```bash
   cp -r react-tailwind-starter frontend-mentor-challenges/3-column-preview-card
   ```

4. **Navigate into the new folder**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend-mentor-challenges/3-column-preview-card
   ```

5. **Remove any `.git` folder (if present)** to prevent nested Git repos:

   ```bash
   rm -rf .git
   ```

6. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

7. **Run the dev server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### ðŸ§  Optional: Clean Up `package.json`

* Change the project name to match your challenge:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "3-column-preview-card",
    ...
  }
  ```

âœ… How to Start a New Branch for Your Challenge

From the root of your repo:

```bash
git checkout -b challenge/3-column-preview-card
```

Now youâ€™re on a new branch called challenge/3-column-preview-card, and all your changes â€” including the copied starter, your code, and assets â€” will live here.

ðŸ§¼ Optional: Once You Finish the Challenge

You can merge back to main:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge challenge/3-column-preview-card
```


Or just leave it as-is if you want to keep challenges on separate branches.

### ðŸš€ You're Ready!

Now you can start working on your challenge using the clean setup from the starter.
